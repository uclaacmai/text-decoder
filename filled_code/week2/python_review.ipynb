    "# Python\n",
    "A brief intro\n",
    "### History\n",
    "A new language was born in 1989 when developer, and later self-acclaimed \"Benevolent Dictator For Life [of the languague]\", Guido Van Rossum decided to make a version of ABC (a programming language best known for inspiring Python) that doesn't just look like a reskined SQL query. He would later go on to name this programming language Python after the BBC’s TV Show – 'Monty Python’s Flying Circus', one of his favorite shows at the time.\n",
    "### Why Python\n",
    "According to Tiobe (as of July 8, 2024) Python is the number one programming language, for a good reason too. Because of it's simple, english reminicent, syntax Python has become popular for a number of applications:\n",
    "- Competitive programming (it's fast to type)\n",
    "- Web apps (Flask, Django, ect.)\n",
    "- Data Science (NumPy, Pandas, ect.)\n",
    "- Deep Learning (PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow)\n",
    "### Jargon\n",
    "Python is a garbage collected, dynamically typed, multi-paradigm programming langauge. Which is to say\n",
    "- You don't have to worry about tracking memory\n",
    "- Variable typing is determined for you\n",
    "- It supports many coding styles such as object-oriented, imperitive, and functional (to name a few)\n",
    "### Internals\n",
    "- Instead of scopes python has \"namespaces\" which map variables (names) to literal values\n",
    "- All variables are passed by refrence\n",
    "- *Everything* in python is an object\n",
    "### Compiled or Not?\n",
    "Most people consider Python interpreted due to the fact that it is built to run on an interpreter. However you may notice that sometimes python will generate a \\_\\_pycache\\_\\_ folder which contains .pyc files. These are the result of Python compiling a .py file to byte code for it's interpreter. Sometimes when a specific line is called enough python will call it's just in time (JIT) compiler which compiles those lines to byte code that runs on your processor. So \"compiled vs interpreted\" is clearly a bit loose when it comes to Python (and many other modern languages)."
